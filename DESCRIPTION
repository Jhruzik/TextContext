Description: This package is meant to be used in text mining applications whenever the user is interested to know about the presence of A within the context of B and has only limited knowledge of regular expressions. It makes the construction of such regular expressions easy and assumes no knowledge of regular expression.
    In general, it is assumed that the user has two complex entities (e.g. topics) which are represented as sets of words and wants to know wheter either one entity is near the other entity within given text strings.
